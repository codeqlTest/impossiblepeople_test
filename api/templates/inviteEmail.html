		<p>Hello!</p>
		<p>I want to invite you to be part of something awesome. Itâ€™s pretty simple and there are no catches.</p>

		<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/impossible-people/id1116732589">Download the app here!</a></p>

		<p>Impossible is about discovering and tapping into the community you never knew you had. This community can be friends, friends of friends and maybe a favourite neighbour. Then their friends and, well, you get the idea. Through sharing we enable a sense of togetherness that is often missing in modern life.</p>

		<p>The cynical proudly declare this spirit of community to be long dead. We say goodwill and kindness are a timeless human energy and just, occasionally, need a bit of a friendly shove.</p>
		
		<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

# Contributing Guidelines

## Code of Conduct

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration. All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct. Thank you for being kind to each other!

## Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search [issues](../../issues/) and [pull requests](../../pulls/) before adding something new! This helps avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes any kind of contribution! Here are a few suggestions:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included content.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.
- **Code**: help maintain and improve the project codebase.

## Code Style

This repository uses a coding style based on [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to maintain code style and consistency, and to avoid style arguments.

Use [.eslintrc](./api/.eslintrc) to configure this style on your editor automatically.

## Project Governance

**This is an [OPEN Open Source Project](http://openopensource.org/).**

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

### Rules

There are a few basic ground rules for collaborators:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.
1. Ensure tests pass (`npm run api:test` for the API server, for example) prior to sending.

### Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

### Any feedback is welcome
